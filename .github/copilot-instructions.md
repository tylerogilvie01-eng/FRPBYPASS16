# AI Coding Agent Instructions for FRPBYPASS16

## Project Status
This repository is currently in the planning/setup phase. It contains minimal template content from GitHub's default profile files. The main codebase structure and core functionality need to be defined.

## Architecture Overview
**Current State**: Template-only repository with no implemented codebase yet.

**Key Files**:
- `README.md` - GitHub profile template (to be populated with project details)
- `Www.frpbypass16.ml` - Additional profile content file
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - This file (AI agent guidelines)

## Development Workflow
*To be established once core project structure is defined.*

When implementing features, ensure:
- Clear separation of concerns in module organization
- Documentation of integration points between components
- Consistent error handling patterns throughout the codebase

## Project-Specific Conventions
*To be established as the project develops.*

## Current Next Steps for AI Agents
When contributing to this project:
1. **Ask for clarification** on the project's purpose, target domain, and primary use cases
2. **Request architecture documentation** before implementing features
3. **Suggest appropriate patterns** based on the intended project scope (web app, library, CLI tool, etc.)
4. **Reference this file** and update it as patterns emerge during development
